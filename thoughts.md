# Even from the first class of Mod 0, I could really tell a vast difference in community and experience than any other educational setting I've ever experienced. It was immediately accepting and had a feeling that everyone is there to help each other learn better. It wasn't a competition to be the best, but a group effort to learn

# Surprisingly, the etiquette of the zoom calls was very good right out of the gate. The fact that everyone has been extremely respectful and proper is amazing. Not to mention the seemingly automatic action of keeping your mic off until you are speaking being so widely understood.

# Strategies:
# Looking up the answer for just a bit longer before asking for help.
# Looking ahead of course material.

# Shoutout
# Michael Marchand has been an incredible help in understand principles of git and cloning.

# Additional thoughts:
# Submarines don't have windows
